# Storage types
There are many types of storage that can be used to store data. These are the most common types used in the Cloud:

## File
This is the most known storage type. You use this to interact with the storage inside your computer. File storage is storing your data in a directorystructure. You can use NFS or SMB protocols to access file storage over a network.

This is the most commonly used method to share data on a network.

## Block
This is the type of storage that is used to store data on a block device. A disk is partitioned into blocks. Each block is a fixed size. These blocks are then filled with the data of your files. A filesystem is responsible for the organization of the blocks and maintaining a record of the locations of your data. A file can be stored in multiple blocks.

## Object
Object storage stores data in a way that is optimized for the storage of large amounts of data. This is the most common type of storage used in the Cloud. An object is a collection of data stored in a single object. The metadata is stored in a separate object called an object manifest. The object manifest contains a list of all the objects that are part of the object, its size, owner, and the location of the objects.

You can access this storage using a REST API. This makes it great for use on the internet.
