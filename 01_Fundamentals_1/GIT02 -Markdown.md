## Git 02 Markdown


Markdown
is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.

To summarize, this is a four-part process:

1.Create a Markdown file using a text editor or a dedicated Markdown application. The file should have an .md or .markdown extension.
2.Open the Markdown file in a Markdown application.
3.Use the Markdown application to convert the Markdown file to an HTML document.
4.View the HTML file in a web browser or use the Markdown application to convert it to another file format, like PDF.

WYSIWYG vs WYSIWYM
WYSIWYG is what you see is what you get. So it implies the ability to directly manipulate the layout of a document without having to type or remember names of layout commands.
WYSIWYM is what you see is what you means it displays the result of a formatted document as it will appear on screen or in printâ€”without showing the descriptive code underneath.
