# Users and groups
Users and groups
introduction:
linux has users, similar to accounts on windows and macos. every user has their own home directory. users can also be part of groups.
there is a special user called ‘root’. Root is allowed to do anything.
To gain temporary root permissions, you can type ‘sudo’ in front of a command, but that only works if you’re allowed to do that.

Some actions require (root) permissions.

Users, passwords, and groups are all stored in  (different) files across the system.
