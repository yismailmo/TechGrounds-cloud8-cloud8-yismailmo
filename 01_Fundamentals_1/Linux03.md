# Working with text (CLI)
Introduction:
Every command in Linux has a standard input and output.
The standard input (stdin) is the keyboard. If I run ‘mkdir myfolder’, the mkdir command will know what folder to create, because I typed ‘myfolder’.
The standard output (stdout) is the terminal. The command ‘echo hello’ will write ‘hello’ in the terminal.

Both the input and output can be redirected to a file instead of the default. This is called input redirection and output redirection. 
A pipe can be used to have the output of one command be the input of another command.

Requirements:
Your Linux machine
A text file with 2 lines of text
Exercise:
Use the echho command and output redirection to write a new sentence into your text file using the command line. The new sentence should contain the word ‘techgrounds’. 

First step is to create a techgrounds file and edit itby adding the text in nano the following text file 

Hi
Techgrounds enjoy your journey.
techground
in nano the  the text file by

by using the following command
nano samen.txt

Then I added the text techgrounds by redirecting it to the file techgrounds.txt using the following command
echo "techground" >> techgrounds.txt

to test that the techgrounds.txt file had been edited I used the following command
cat "techgrounds.txt"




Use a command to write the contents of your text file to the terminal. Make use of a command to filter the output so that only the sentence containing ‘techgrounds’ appears.


So for this I created another text file and I edited the following sentence 'techgrounds is top' by using the following command
nano samen.txt
So inorder to only highlight the word 'techgrounds' in the samen.txt file i used 
grep "techgrounds" samen.txt


Read your text file with the command used in the second step, once again filtering for the word ‘techgrounds’. This time, redirect the output to a new file called ‘techgrounds.txt’.

To read and filter for the word 'techground' in the file i used 
grep "techgrounds" samen.txt

After that i redirect the output by 
grep "techgrounds" samen.txt >> nieuwesamen.txt

So to test the redirection went good i used
 cat nieuwesamen.txt


After that I redirect it to a new file techgrounds.txt
mv nieuwesamen.txt techgrounds.txt

To test this again
cat nieuwesamen.txt
