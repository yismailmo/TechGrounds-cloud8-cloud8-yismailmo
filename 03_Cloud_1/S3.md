# S3
Simple Storage Service (S3) is an object storate service provided by AWS. It is a cloud storage service that stores data in buckets. And can be accessed using a REST API.

AWS makes certain that the file is stored durably. Your files are replicated accross the Availability Zones in your region. AWS claims that their durability is 99.999999999% (11 9's) and an availability of 99.99%.

Buckets are stored within a region. However, its name should be unique globally and it should be DNS compatible.

S3 has several storage classes through which you pay on a sliding scale for either free retrieval and a higher fee for storage, and a lower storage fee but you pay for retrieval.

### Overcome challanges
- At first I couldn't access my own files through the browser.
    - I searched for `Access denied S3 bucket` on Google and found a solution.
    - I had to update the access permissions to allow the public to access the bucket.

### Results 
My teammembers were able to download my photos.
